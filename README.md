# Graph neural networks for time series forecasting in water management

This repository contains code for my master thesis, *Graph neural networks for time series forecasting in water management*. The model created is a single-layer, encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is built from graph convolutional LSTM (GConvLSTM) cells based on Chebyshev polynomials, and the decoder is built from classical LSTMs. 

The code is written in Python and the training and visualization are done in Jupyter notebook.
